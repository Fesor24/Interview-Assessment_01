# Interview Assessment

This project forms part of an assessment from a job application.

The first task was to use any tool of my choice to automate the conversion and merging of txt files into a tabular format. I used Python to do that.

The second task was to generate a report from data that was sent to me. I analysed the data using Python and generated a pdf report using the FPDF library package in Python.
